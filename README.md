# twitchbot
This is a (simple) twitch bot.
If you want to know some more about it, you can read my blog (http://psittacus.subnetworx.de/) if you can speak german :D

There is are a few Methods. 

* *Welcome, %username%* if someone writes "Hey" in the Chat
* *!werbung* lets the bot print some commercial.
* *!start bet time* starts the time, in which normal users can do the
* *!bet* where they can bet how for example the CS:GO Match ends. After
* *!end bet time* no one can vote anymore. And if the Match ends, you can type
* *!findTheWinner* and the SQLite Database is asked for a winner.
